# hello-world
GitHub Tutorial

This is a test of GH and how it might work in a school setting.

##This code was added via Byword on the desktop from the Hello-world folder in my github folder.

###Now I've added even more changes after I applied them.

Now I am trying to figure out how to merge pull requests from the desktop app.
